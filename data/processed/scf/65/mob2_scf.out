     Parallel version (MPI), running on     8 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       8
     557 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
     Reading input from mob2_scf.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
