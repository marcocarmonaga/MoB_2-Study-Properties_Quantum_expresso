     Parallel version (MPI), running on     8 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       8
     386 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
     Reading input from mob2_nscf.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     Atomic positions and unit cell read from directory:
     ./tmp/mob2.save/
     Atomic positions from file used, from input discarded
 
     [opt_tetra]  Optimized tetrahedron method is used.
